lib.container.defaulttable

Providing a table as the initial value will result in a shallow copy of
the given table being made when a key is initially accessed. Providing a
(zero argument) function will result in the function being called to
obtain the initial value. Providing any other value will result in that
value being used as the initial value for keys (which could result
structural sharing between keys).
